Exploratory Data Analysis of the Rocket League Tabular Playground Series on Kaggle:

Rocket League is a vehicle based soccer (football) game where the aim is to score more goals that your opponents while controlling a car.

The dataset consists of sequences of snapshots of the state of a Rocket League match, including position and velocity of all players and the ball, as well as extra information. The goal of the competition is to predict -- from a given snapshot in the game -- for each team, the probability that they will score within the next 10 seconds of game time.

The data was taken from professional Rocket League matches. Each event consists of a chronological series of frames recorded at 10 frames per second.
